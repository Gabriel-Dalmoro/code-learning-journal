Learning about OOP (object-oriented programming).

### The four pillars of OOP

- Encapsulation: group related variables and functions (methods) together.

Reduce complexity and increase reusability

- Abstraction: reduce complexity and isolate the impact of changes.

- Inheritance: eliminate redundant code

- Polymorphism: refactor switch/case statements
